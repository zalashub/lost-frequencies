# Lost Frequencies

*Final project for the Creative Projects 1 module at university.*

Lost Frequencies is an interactive web-based program representing a **speculative reality**. Contrived as an explorative game, it’s focus is on the concept, narration and user experience. 

Upon starting the game, the player enters a world stripped of language where the main form of communication are light and sounds emerging from interaction between the characters’ auras. These are assigned to people as they are born in the world, meaning each person is characterised by the colour of their aura and the sound accompanying it, both of which are clearly visible to the individual and everyone around them. 

Consequently, the world becomes rather “transparent,” since people’s true intentions are perceived from the onset, leading to less miscommunication in comparison to our reality. Therefore, the project’s purpose is to get the user to **question how they communicate with others** in the real world, as it is usually **affected by superficial factors** (gender, race, sexuality, etc.).

Made with **p5.js**, **ml5.js** and **maxiLib.js**.
